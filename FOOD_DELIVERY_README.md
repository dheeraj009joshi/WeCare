# Food Delivery Backend Implementation

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a complete backend for food delivery to match your frontend requirements. The backend includes:

- âœ… **Models**: Restaurant, MenuItem, FoodCategory, FoodCart, FoodOrder, FoodOrderItem
- âœ… **Controllers**: Complete CRUD operations for all food delivery functionality
- âœ… **Routes**: RESTful API endpoints for restaurants, menu items, cart, and orders
- âœ… **Seed Data**: Sample restaurants and menu items matching your frontend
- âœ… **Integration**: Fully integrated into your existing app.js

## Database Models Created

### 1. FoodCategory
- Categories like "khichdi", "fruits", "juice", "soups", "porridge"
- Used for filtering restaurants and menu items

### 2. Restaurant
- Restaurant details (name, cuisine, rating, delivery time, price range)
- Location and contact information
- Operating hours and status

### 3. MenuItem
- Menu items for each restaurant
- Pricing, ingredients, nutritional information
- Dietary preferences (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free)

### 4. FoodCart
- User's cart items with quantities
- Links to menu items and restaurants
- Special instructions support

### 5. FoodOrder
- Complete order information
- Payment method and delivery address
- Order status tracking (pending â†’ confirmed â†’ preparing â†’ delivered)

### 6. FoodOrderItem
- Individual items in an order
- Snapshot of item details at time of order
- Pricing and quantity information

## API Endpoints

### Public Routes
```
GET /api/food-delivery/categories              # Get all food categories

### Protected Routes (require authentication)
```

## Sample Data Included

### Menu Items (13 total)
- Each restaurant has 2-3 menu items matching your frontend data
- Prices, descriptions, and nutritional information included
- Popular items marked for frontend display

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
Ensure PostgreSQL is running and create a database named `wecure`:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE wecure;
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Make sure your `.env` file has the correct database credentials:
```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=wecure
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 4. Seed Food Delivery Data
```bash
npm run seed:food-delivery
```

### 5. Start the Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Frontend Integration

The API endpoints are designed to work directly with your existing frontend code. The response formats match what your frontend expects:

### Restaurant List Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "restaurants": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Healthy Khichdi Point",
      "category": "khichdi",
      "cuisine": "Moong Dal Khichdi, Veg Khichdi",
      "rating": 4.9,
      "deliveryTime": "20 mins",
      "priceRange": "â‚¹120-â‚¹200",
      "image": "...",
      "menuItems": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Cart Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "cartItems": [...],
  "summary": {
    "totalItems": 3,
    "subtotal": 350.00,
    "deliveryFee": 30.00,
    "taxes": 17.50,
    "total": 397.50
  }
}
```

## Testing the Backend

### 1. Test Restaurant Endpoints
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/food-delivery/restaurants
```

### 2. Test Categories
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/food-delivery/categories
```

### 3. Test with Authentication
```bash
# First login to get token
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@test.com", "password": "test123"}'

# Then use token for cart operations
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/food-delivery/cart \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Database Relationships

```
User â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€ FoodCart â”€â”€ MenuItem â”€â”€ Restaurant
       â””â”€â”€ FoodOrder â”€â”€ FoodOrderItem â”€â”€ MenuItem â”€â”€ Restaurant
```

## Error Handling

All endpoints include comprehensive error handling:
- Authentication errors (401)
- Validation errors (400)
- Not found errors (404)
- Server errors (500)

## Next Steps

1. **Start the backend server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Seed the data**: `npm run seed:food-delivery`
3. **Test with your frontend**: The API endpoints should work seamlessly
4. **Customize as needed**: Modify restaurants, menu items, or business logic

The backend is now complete and ready to power your food delivery frontend! ðŸŽ‰

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running
- Check database credentials in `.env`
- Create the database if it doesn't exist

### Port Conflicts
- Default port is 5000
- Change `PORT` in `.env` if needed

### Authentication Issues
- Ensure user authentication is working
- Check JWT token format
- Verify middleware configuration
